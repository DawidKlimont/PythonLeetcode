Just a storage for all the Leetcode solutions I made in Python.
I am trying to get as many questions done as possible to improve my ability to rapidly produce good code.
Why Python? Because from my experience it lets me code faster then Java, JS, C# or god forbid C++ or Rust.
But it definetly isnt the fastest since that crown would be with Rust, but the point of improving my coding is to be able to create efficient algos instead of relying on a fast language.
